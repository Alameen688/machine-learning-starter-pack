# Introduction to Machine Learning 

## What's all the buzz about
If you're a dev, i'm sure by now you've heard alot about machine learning.
Everyone's talking about it, but not much people know what it really means. For most people, all they know is that, machine learning is what makes most of our apps today do cool stuff.
Ever wondered how snapchat always gets those dog filters to come on your face ( placing the crown well on your head)? 
Ever wondered how Netflix gets the idea that ' Because you watched ' "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D" you'd like to watch "Luke Cage"?
or how Amazon knows to show you "Macbook Pro Cases" after looking-up/buying a "Macbook Pro" from their website? 

It's all MACHINE LEARNING. 
In this introduction, we are going to be looking at the basics of Machine Learning, types of learning, advantages of machine learning, and how we can leverage machine learning by using APIs.

## What is Machine Learning
In the most basic of terms, machine learning is the ability of the computer to predict future events based off of data it has collected of past events. Obviously machine learning is not just about generating
predictions, machine learning also involves the understanding of data samples and categorizing them into clusters i.e grouping them and making sense off of what we have.
Before we continue, I want to make it clear :
The 👏🏾 output 👏🏾  of 👏🏾  your 👏🏾  model 👏🏾  is 👏🏾  highly 👏🏾  dependent 👏🏾  on 👏🏾  the 👏🏾  data 👏🏾  you 👏🏾 train 👏🏾  the 👏🏾 model 👏🏾  with!

## Types of Learning
Generally learning algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories.
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

## Advantages of Machine Learning

## Examples of Machine Learning Models

## Machine Learning APIs
- Kairos API
- Tensorflow
- Microsoft's API
- Scikit Learn
